# odin-recipes

This is the recipe project in Odin. It is the first project in the foundations course. I'm going to make it bear themed and ironic so it still keeps my interest while making it. It should improve my knowledge on basic HTML like links, paragraphs, images, and basic text formatting using <em> and <strong>.
